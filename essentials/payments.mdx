## Payment provider of choice

Cascade uses [Lemon Squeezy](https://lemonsqueezy.com) as the merchant of record. Lemon Squeezy is a payment gateway that allows you to accept payments from your customers. It is a secure and reliable payment gateway that supports multiple payment methods. It also handles all tax related things for you.

## Setup on Lemon Squeezy side

<Warning>
  Make sure you are doing all of the below in test mode. You can switch between
  test and live in the Lemon Squeezy dashboard.

To start accepting even test payments, you need to [set up a new store](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/store/new).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ls-test.jpeg" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Next step is to create some test products. You can do that [here](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/products).

Let's start with a simple product. You can create a product by clicking on the `New Product` button.

Choose Subscription and select $9.99 as the price for collection every month.

  <img src="/images/ls-month-sub.jpeg" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Now let's creat two variants of this Product, we will call it `Yearly` & `Monthly` and set the price to $9 & $100 respectively.

  <img src="/images/ls-variant.jpeg" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/ls-variant-yearly.jpeg"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

Save your product and variants, you should have deftault monthly subscription and yearly subscription now!

Go to [stores page](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/stores) and copy the store ID.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/ls-stores.jpeg" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Go to [api keys page](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/api) and create an API key. Copy it as well.

<Tip>

Name your API key corresponding to your store so you could rotate it later if needed.

</Tip>

## Setup on Cascade side

Now that you have your store ID and API key, you can set up Cascade to use Lemon Squeezy as the payment provider.

Inside of `.env` file add the following:

```yml
#Lemon Squeezy
LEMON_SQUEEZY_API_KEY="COPY_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
LEMON_SQUEEZY_STORE_ID="COPY_YOUR_STORE_ID_HERE"
LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET="super-secret-long-string"
LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_URL="https://cascade.loca.lt/api/lemon-squeezy/webhook"
```

<Warning>
  We are using local tunnel for webhook URL, you should replace cascade with
  your app name and generate correct connection in the next step.
</Warning>

Visit the Lemon Squeezy setup page on Cascade dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/ls-setup`

<Warning>
  Make sure you are signed in and your user has `SUPER_ADMIN` role.
</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/ls-setup-dashboard.jpeg"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

Run `npx localtunnel --port 3000 --subdomain cascade` with replacing cascade with your domain. This will make sure we are able to receive webhooks from Lemon Squeezy locally.

You can now click two buttons to create a webhook and create plans in our database that correspond to Lemon Squeezy subsriptions.

- `Create webhook` button will create a webhook on Lemon Squeezy side, so we can receive events. This is just a nice utility to setup webhooks without going to Lemon Squeezy dashboard.
- `Sync plans` button will create plans in our database that correspond to Lemon Squeezy subscriptions. This is needed so we can match Lemon Squeezy events to our plans.
